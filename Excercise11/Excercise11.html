                    <h4>Summary</h4>
                    <p>The Mini Cooper hatchback is stylish inside and out and offers more affordable petrol engines compared with its eco-friendly electric alternative, but it’s not very practical</p>
                    <h4>Exterior</h4>
                    <p>The new petrol-powered Mini Cooper hatchback is a bit like keeping your vinyl collection and a record player in the age of Spotify. Sure, technological advancement towards electric cars is great and all, but sometimes you just want something simple and fun. It's still very good – so much so, it was awarded Highly Commended status in the Urban Living Award category of the 2025 Carwow Car of the Year Awards.</p>

                    <h1>About G-Class
                    </h1>
                    <h4>Summary</h4>
                    <p>The Mercedes-Benz G-Class, colloquially known as the G-Wagon or G-Wagen[3] (as an abbreviation of Geländewagen), is a four-wheel drive luxury SUV manufactured by Magna Steyr (formerly Steyr-Daimler-Puch) in Graz, Styria, Austria, and sold by Mercedes-Benz. Originally developed as a military off-roader, later more luxurious models were added to the line. In certain markets, it was sold under the Puch name as Puch G until 2000.</p>
                    <h4>Exterior</h4>
                    <p>The G-Wagen is characterised by its boxy styling and body-on-frame construction. It uses three fully locking differentials, one of the few passenger car vehicles to have such a feature. Despite the introduction of an intended replacement, the unibody SUV Mercedes-Benz GL-Class in 2006, the G-Class is still in production and is one of the longest-produced vehicles in Daimler's history, with a span of 45 years. Only the Unimog surpasses it.[4] In 2018, Mercedes-Benz introduced the second-generation W463 with heavily revised chassis, powertrain, body, and interior. In 2023, Mercedes-Benz announced plans to launch a smaller version of the G-Class, named "little G"—though no definitive date was given for the launch.[5]</p>
